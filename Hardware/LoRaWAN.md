# LoRaWAN

You need to have a reachable LoRaWAN Gateway which is connected to TTN. You can use the [TTN Mapper](https://ttnmapper.org/) to find a gateway.

If there is no gateway in your area, you may want to build your own gateway. You can find a lot of tutorials on the internet.

To connect your gateway to TTN, you have to register it. You can find a tutorial [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/registration.html).
